# Xinference Rerank Format

"Important Note"
In AIsa, Xinference's rerank response structure will be formatted as Jina's rerank response structure, with the same usage as Jina's rerank. **For Dify and other client users**: When configuring, please select **Jina AI** as the provider type, not Xinference, and use the model names supported by Xinference.

## 📝 Introduction

Xinference's rerank API is fully compatible with Jina AI's rerank API. Please refer to the [Jina AI Rerank Format](jinaai-rerank.md) documentation for detailed usage methods, request parameters, and response formats.

## 💡 Usage

When using Xinference rerank API, simply set the `model` parameter to a rerank model supported by Xinference. All other parameters and usage methods are the same as Jina AI's rerank API.

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://api.aisa.one/v1/rerank \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d ''
```
